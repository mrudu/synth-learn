	<p class="introduction">
		In this example, we consider an elevator system that traverses between two floors.
		Each floor has a button that can be pressed to <i>call</i> the elevator to that floor.
		The movement of the elevator is controlled by the arbiter that ensures "liveness" property, i.e., every floor button pressed implies elevator will eventually "reach" the floor and "serve" that floor.
	</p>
	<h4 class="text-dark">Design Specifications/Requirements</h4>
	<p>
		To synthesize an efficient arbiter, we must express the precise design specifications. We can express these specifications formally in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
		The atomic propositions <span class="LTL">p, q</span> represent the requests made by processes P and Q.
		The atomic propositions <span class="LTL">gp, gq</span> represent the accesses granted to P and Q.
		We classify the design specifications as <b>Safety</b> and <b>Functionality/Fairness</b>.
