	<p class="introduction">
		In this example, we consider three processes P, Q and R that perform operations on/interacts with a critical section. Our goal is to synthesize an efficient arbiter which will control access of these processes to the critical section.
	</p>
	<h4 class="text-dark">Design Specifications/Requirements</h4>
	<p>
		To synthesize an efficient arbiter, we must express the precise design specifications. We can express these specifications formally in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
		The atomic propositions <span class="LTL">p, q, r</span> represent the requests made by processes P, Q and R.
		The atomic propositions <span class="LTL">gp, gq, gr</span> represent the accesses granted to P, Q and R.
		We classify the design specifications as <b>Safety</b> and <b>Functionality</b>.
	</p>

			<h4 class="text-dark">Safety Specifications</h4>
			<p>
				We must ensure that no two processes can access the critical section at the same time. We can express in LTL as:
				<span class="LTL">G ((!gp & !gr) | (!gq & !gr) | (!gp & !gq))</span>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-auto col-md-6">
			<h4 class="text-dark">Functionality Specifications</h4>
			<p>
				Every request made must be granted. We can express in LTL as:
				<span class="LTL">G (p -> F gp) & G (q -> F gq) & G (r -> F gr)</span>
			</p>
